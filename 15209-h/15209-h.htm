<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>For this new day, our Father, we give thee thanks.<br /></span>
<span>Thou hast blessed us with rest for our bodies,<br /></span>
<span>The glories of a new day are upon us, a gift from above.<br /></span>
<span>Let the light from heaven penetrate our souls,<br /></span>
<span>and may this be the best of our lives, we pray.<br /></span>
<span>Remember those less fortunate, dear Father,<br /></span>
<span>May some messenger of thine bring joy to their hearts today.<br /></span>
<span>Forbid we should shirk any duty coming our way,<br /></span>
<span>for we are thy servants and desire to do thy will.<br /></span>
<span>Our Dear Father thou hast blessed us with many dear ones.<br /></span>
<span>I pray thy blessing upon each one, especially our soldier boys<br /></span>
<span>That they may heed thy voice and follow thee<br /></span>
<span>as their great and true leader. Forbid, dear Lord, that any one<br /></span>
<span>of them be lost from the way in his search for the light.<br /></span>
<span>Go before them and let light from above<br /></span>
<span>make their pathway bright. Come into their hearts<br /></span>
<span>and give them the peace that no man can give, neither can<br /></span>
<span>take it away. I humbly ask these favors in Jesus name.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Let there be peace, let clouds and storm roll past,<br /></span>
<span>And budding groves burst forth in little leaves.<br /></span>
<span>When April showers flush the brooks and eaves;<br /></span>
<span>May gardens grow and wheat go flowing fast.<br /></span>
<span>Let there be peace on earth, that men may cast<br /></span>
<span>Their hatreds far away and gather sheaves<br /></span>
<span>Of golden days in patterns justice weaves;<br /></span>
<span>That sunset hours may glow with love at last,<br /></span>
<span>The atmosphere be filled with faith and light,<br /></span>
<span>No war, nor bombs, no words of discontent.<br /></span>
<span>Let there be peace on every hill and plain,<br /></span>
<span>That men may live and toil with hearts alight,<br /></span>
<span>That each may aid his brother in content.<br /></span>
<span>Let grasses grow and flowers bloom again.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Remaining staunchly there in shriveled earth,<br /></span>
<span>The canna stood serene, refreshed by dew<br /></span>
<span>That silently, each cooling night anew<br /></span>
<span>Spread living gems to sparkle in their mirth.<br /></span>
<span>Beneath, the bulb lay proving well its birth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A shower passed, the funnel leaves caught true&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The plant awoke with life and beauty too.<br /></span>
<span>And not a drop was wasted of the worth!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The bud refrained from coming into bloom,<br /></span>
<span>As though it waited for the lusty rain,<br /></span>
<span>With low leaves dried and drooping to the ground.<br /></span>
<span>What is this wisdom in all nature's room<br /></span>
<span>That fights to live and grow, and not in vain,<br /></span>
<span>But God, whose strength in all things may be found.<br /></span>

<span>Hear the tramping, marching feet,<br /></span>
<span>All in line stepping fine<br /></span>

<span>The good and bad blend in a sparkling stream.<br /></span>
<span>If one recalls youth's glad and care free ways;<br /></span>
<span>The distant roar of music is supreme,<br /></span>
<span>When viewing life's almost forgotten trail.<br /></span>
<span>There is a stream that twines its way about<br /></span>
<span>Through shady spots, by broken, rotted rail.<br /></span>
<span>The falling water glitters, and the trout,<br /></span>
<span>Again, like precious memories, flash and dart.<br /></span>
<span>Through bleak and cold, a precipice once crossed<br /></span>
<span>Still fills with pride and pain the aging heart;<br /></span>
<span>For time has now the thorns and rocks embossed,<br /></span>

<span>As perking coffee roused the hungry sprite;<br /></span>
<span>Beside the hearth a friendly pussy purred,<br /></span>
<span>And in a crib a blue-eyed baby stirred,<br /></span>
<span>Awakened from sweet slumber of the night.<br /></span>
<span>O dawning! Here with all her usual charm.<br /></span>
<span>Another day to toil for child and friend,<br /></span>
<span>One hour to praise our God, while hatreds ebbed;<br /></span>
<span>To hope and live and succor from all harm<br /></span>

<span>To bring relief to those who toss in waves.<br /></span>
<span>They care for mothers left to starve, alone.<br /></span>
<span>In pestilence, they labor long to soothe<br /></span>
<span>The fevered brow and ease the gnawing pain<br /></span>
<span>With medicine and shelter, food and clothes.<br /></span>
<span>In war the wound is dressed and duly nursed<br /></span>
<span>With gentle supple hands&mdash;with nourishment<br /></span>
<span>For mind and body. Cross of red, all hail!<br /></span>
<span>They serve for us most willingly and well.<br /></span>
<span>Then chide themselves when they have come too late!<br /></span>
<span>Like mothers when their sons have fallen short;<br /></span>
<span>In early dawn and through the night they toil.<br /></span>
<span>O God do bless this noble work of love;<br /></span>
<span>Let's give and further this most worthy cause.<br /></span>
<span>All hail Red Cross! White robes of hope, all hail!<br /></span>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
